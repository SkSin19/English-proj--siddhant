    <h2>3.1 A Study in Scarlet</h2>

    <p>
      The first time that the reader comes in contact with Sherlock Holmes, in
      the novel, is when Watson is talking to a former colleague and mentions
      that he is in need of someone to share an apartment in London, because he
      spends a lot of money and is starting to have financial problems.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not care
      for him as a constant companion." "Why, what is there against him?" "Oh, I
      didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his
      ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a
      decent fellow enough."
    </span>

    <p>
      Judging by this depiction of Sherlock Holmes, the reader does not have a
      good first impression. But when Watson meets him for the first time,
      Holmes is enthusiastic:
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      "I've found it! I've found it," he shouted to Stamford. "I have found a
      re-agent which is precipitated by hemoglobin, and by nothing else."
    </span>

    <p>
      In the novel, all the qualifications by function are given by Watson’s
      point of view.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass
      from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about
      the room... I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained
      foxhound... (DOYLE, 2014, p. 34)
    </span>

    <p>
      While sharing his thoughts and deductions about the crime, Sherlock Holmes
      also explains some of his methods used to reach certain conclusions.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      "The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in
      blood... I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have
      written a monograph upon the subject... It is just in such details that
      the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type." (DOYLE,
      2014, p. 38)

      “Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a

      “I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer... There
      was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.”
      (DOYLE, 2014, p. 67)
    </span>

    <span className="red-text">
      Holmes had taken out his watch... an expression of the utmost chagrin and
      disappointment appeared upon his features... So great was his emotion,
      that I felt sincerely sorry for him... (DOYLE, 2014, p. 69)
    </span>

    <span className="red-text">
      "I confess," said I, "that I do not quite follow you." "Let me see if I
      can make it clearer... Most people... will tell you what the result would
      be... There are few people, however, who... would be able to evolve...
      what the steps were... This is reasoning backwards." (DOYLE, 2014, p. 139)
    </span>

    <span className="red-text">
      "No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to
      my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning... There is no
      branch of detective science... so important... as the art of tracing
      footsteps." (DOYLE, 2014, p. 140)
    </span>

    <span className="red-text">
      "It is wonderful!" I cried. "Your merits should be publicly recognized.
      You should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for you."
      "You may do what you like, Doctor," he answered... "Didn't I tell you so
      when we started?" cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. "That's the result
      of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!" "Never mind," I
      answered, "I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know
      them." (DOYLE, 2014, P. 143)
    </span>

    <p>
      Judging by this depiction of Sherlock Holmes, the reader does not have a
      good impression. Stamford, through his affirmations, is already beginning
      to characterize Holmes; the character then can act according to what is
      already perceived of him by another character, or it can surprise the
      narrator – and reader. Some information that appears in the excerpt above
      will be a little later on seen again, thus enabling Sherlock’s image to be
      partially constructed by the repetition of important characteristics.
      After having met Holmes and living with him for a couple of days, Watson
      then can give us his own perception of the character – still very biased,
      now even more because the information is filtered through the narrator.
      One of the first contradictions to the image painted by Stamford is that
      the man is not a bad or difficult roommate as previously advertised.
      Describing Sherlock’s habits and routine, the narrator provides a slightly
      more concrete image of the character in a very interesting way. The report
      seems to be very objective for the lay reader, but the more specialized
      one knows that, no matter how impartial the narrator appears to be, it
      always narrates from a certain point of view and focalized on someone (or
      something). One of the proofs of this is the use of the words “appeared”
      and “I might have suspected”, which serve to reinforce the notion that
      this is a very specific perspective of narration, in the paragraph below.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his
      ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten
      at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in
      the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory,
      sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which
      appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could
      exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a
      reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa
      in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from
      morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant
      expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted
      to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his
      whole life forbidden such a notion. (DOYLE, 2014, p. 12-13)
    </span>

    <p>
      Besides Stamford mentioning that Holmes is not really an extrovert and is
      quiet, in the first passage, in this second one Watson mentions things
      related to this fact twice: when he states that Holmes was somewhat quiet
      and also that he sometimes would just be on the sofa barely making any
      effort to communicate. In less than ten pages this is a qualification that
      is repeated three times, so it is possible to assume that that is an
      important characteristic of Sherlock. Interestingly, Watson also mentions
      narcotics: even though he affirms that he does not think that Sherlock
      would use them because of other reasons in his life, it is one aspect that
      appears in the episode of Elementary, since the character is just out of a
      rehabilitation clinic. Some objectiveness is present in the physical
      description of Holmes when the narrator states facts such as his height
      and his facial features, but it is overthrown by the comparisons Watson
      makes based on his own acquaintanceship with the character. It is
      certainly interesting that the narrator states that he’s spent quite some
      time observing Sherlock in order to make his assessments.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he
      seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save
      during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin,
      hawklike nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.
      His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of
      determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with
      chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I
      frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his
      fragile philosophical instruments. (DOYLE, 2014, p. 13){" "}
    </span>

    <p>
      The narrator mentions twice the quality of decision/determination while
      describing Sherlock’s physical appearance; therefore this excerpt that
      apparently would be solely related to the exterior impressions ends up
      aiding more in the psychological characterization of Sherlock Holmes. The
      narrator then makes a brief interlude to justify his so keen interest in
      the character being described. Claiming that he has no real motivation and
      friends to get out of the apartment in 221B Baker Street, he decided to
      unravel the mystery that is Sherlock.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much
      this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break
      through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself.
      Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was
      my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health
      forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial,
      and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my
      daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little
      mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in
      endeavouring to unravel it. (DOYLE, 2014, p. 13)
    </span>

    <p>
      This passage also helps to remind the reader that this is a story told by
      a character-bound narrator, that is, it is not one hundred percent
      reliable. We have to be conscious throughout the whole story narrated by
      Watson that we cannot completely trust him, even though he sometimes
      disguises his opinions in what seems to be more objective remarks, such as
      what was seen in the excerpt before the above. One very interesting
      passage that cannot be ignored is the following. Watson, while observing
      and noticing the varied knowledge that the character has, ends up having a
      very judgmental attitude, since he is perplexed that Sherlock doesn’t know
      about certain things that are not really relevant to his frame of work.
      Watson makes a list, and instead of naming it “Sherlock Holmes – his
      knowledges” or something similar, he names it “Sherlock Holmes – his
      limits”, and seems to be proud of it.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      4. Politics.—Feeble. 5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium,
      and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. 6.
      Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from
      each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told
      me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received
      them. 7. Chemistry.—Profound. 8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic. 9.
      Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of every
      horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an
      expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 12. Has a good practical
      knowledge of British law. (DOYLE, 2014, p. 15-16)
    </span>

    <p>
      This can be faced as proof of Watson’s judgmental attitude; by listing
      certain aspects of the character, he gives the reader more knowledge and,
      at the same time, creates a standard to aid in the construction of
      adaptations and appropriations of Sherlock. These can be considered the
      basic characteristics of Holmes regarding knowledge and abilities – at
      least initially, since characters can change throughout the works they’re
      part of. In the novel, all the qualifications by function are given by
      Watson’s point of view, that is, the narrator, besides describing
      Sherlock’s actions and behavior, also makes comparisons and gives his own
      interpretation of the facts.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass
      from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about
      the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat
      upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to
      have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his
      breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans,
      whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I
      watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained
      foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining
      in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes
      or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care
      the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and
      occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible
      manner. (DOYLE, 2014, p. 34)
    </span>
    <p>
      In this excerpt, we have a description of Sherlock Holmes acting like a
      detective, investigating the crime scene. The way the character behaves
      while on the scene is very interesting; Sherlock seems to interact with
      the whole scenery using his whole body – he seems invested in what he does
      and very dedicated. The narrator compares Sherlock with a dog (a foxhound)
      due to this dedication to this profession. Watson also mentions that
      Sherlock perceives things that he does not, and that he does not
      understand what the detective does while on the crime scene. These
      elements serve to emphasize yet again that the story is being narrated by
      a character-bound narrator at the same time it qualifies Holmes. While
      sharing his thoughts and deductions about the crime, Sherlock Holmes also
      explains some of his methods used to reach certain conclusions. The
      detective talks about the red writing on the wall – the word RACHE – and
      how it was done.
    </p>
    <span className="red-text">
      "The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood.
      My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in
      doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been
      trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in
      colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have
      made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have written a monograph
      upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the
      ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such
      details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade
      type." (DOYLE, 2014, p. 38)
    </span>
    <p>
      In this excerpt, Sherlock characterizes himself by saying that he has
      written a comprehensive study on the subject of cigar ashes, reinforcing
      the idea that he has extensive knowledge on subjects that are truly
      relevant to his work, thus making him stand out compared to other
      detectives, these being Scotland Yard’s men, Gregson and Lestrade. He does
      stand out indeed, especially considering that Watson yet again compares
      him to a dog in the work: “Leaning back in the cab, this amateur
      bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the
      many-sidedness of the human mind” (DOYLE, 2014, p. 44), and by doing that,
      it seems to emphasize the idea that Sherlock, when investigating a crime,
      has such focus and drive that reminds Watson of dogs used in hunts – the
      character is indeed hunting, in this case, for the guilty person. The
      character is able to remain calm and show no sign of emotion in a
      situation that most people maybe would; upon confirming his deductions
      about the killer, Sherlock remains passive: “I glanced at Holmes on
      hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his
      own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his
      face.” (DOYLE, 2014, p. 67) Watson, by using the word “however”, implies
      that Holmes’ reaction was not expected, further enhancing his different
      and unusual behavior. However, the character is not unable of expressing
      emotions; when he is waiting to prove his hypothesis about the pills being
      poisonous, he shows great signs of distress.
    </p>
    <span className="red-text">
      Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without
      result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared
      upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table,
      and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his
      emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives
      smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.
      (DOYLE, 2014, p. 69)
    </span>
    <p>
      It can be understood that Sherlock Holmes seems to truly engage himself
      with his investigations, while he doesn’t showcase strong emotions towards
      more common events and situations, with those related to his work as a
      detective – especially waiting to see if he’s right – he has a very
      opposite attitude. Considering that we can have repetition in the story
      that is only once present in the written text, it is possible to fit the
      next habit of Sherlock Holmes into his characterization by function: “Thus
      pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to
      walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows
      drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.” (DOYLE, 2014, p. 71)
      Again we have the question of strong emotion related to his work, and also
      an action that is characteristic of a certain state of mind of his that
      Watson has perceived. Still related to his work, Sherlock affirms that, no
      matter what, he would have taken the case; it seems as if no matter how
      gruesome or apparently unsolvable or even morally dubious the case may be,
      he will agree to help in the investigation.
    </p>
    <span className="red-text">
      "What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence," returned my
      companion, bitterly. "The question is, what can you make people believe
      that you have done. Never mind," he continued, more brightly, after a
      pause. "I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has
      been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were
      several most instructive points about it." (DOYLE, 2014, p. 138)
    </span>

    <p>
      Sherlock is also very sure of himself; he knows that his mind works in a
      different way and sometimes doesn’t truly understand how other people do
      not function in the same manner. By the end of the novel, however, he
      already expects that Watson – and everyone else – will not comprehend his
      arguments and deductions about the case, so he explains things in more
      details, and even talks about his own logic thinking.
    </p>

    <span className="red-text">
      "I confess," said I, "that I do not quite follow you." "I hardly expected
      that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you
      describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would
      be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them
      that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if
      you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner
      consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power
      is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically."
      (DOYLE, 2014, p. 139)
    </span>

    <p>
      While explaining his methods of thinking and working, the character
      mentions again that he is different from other people by saying that, for
      him, certain subtle details stand out, and those are the ones that should
      be more carefully examined.

      This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden
      path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable
      for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled
      line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a
      meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and
      so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always
      laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to

    <p>
      It’s as if the mere excitement of the detective work is enough for
      Sherlock; he doesn’t mention being paid to do it by the police and neither
      wants to be credited immediately for the solving of the mystery. The
      character excels at what he does but does not want it to be publicly
      spread and known.
